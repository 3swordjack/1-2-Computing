# 1/2 Computing coding Task
The modules are seperated into a new folder for each project.
The OLD folders and COPY folders that are inside the INCOMPLETE folder are alternative versions of modules, either older working versions or attempts to change large parts of the module that are in progress.
Task 5 is just there because I did it for fun and shouldnt be part of the SAC.
